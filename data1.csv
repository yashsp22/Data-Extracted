Why is there a one dollar transaction on my account?,"
            
             Some merchants will pre-authorize a debit or credit card to ensure that it is a valid and active account, essentially placing a $1 hold on your account. The pre-authorization amount will remain until the merchant submits the actual amount of the transaction for payment and it posts to your account. Once the payment posts, the $1 pre-authorization will come off your account. This process typically takes 2-3 business days.

"What is a ""chip card""?","
            
             Chip cards are payment cards (credit and debit) that have an embedded microchip. Chip cards offer advanced security when making purchases in-store at chip terminals. If you have a chip card, the chip is located on the front of the card. Your card also contains a magnetic stripe on the back to swipe at terminals that have not converted to chip.
                         
            ",Queries
Why are chip card transactions more secure?,"
            
             Chip cards offer advanced security for in-store purchases by making every transaction unique, which makes it more difficult to counterfeit or copy. If the card data and one-time code are stolen, that information cannot be used to commit fraud or create counterfeit cards.
                         
            ",Queries
Will chip cards allow others to track my location?,"
            
             No. Chip card technology is not a locator system. The chip on your card is limited to supporting authentication of card data when you make a purchase.
                         
            ",Queries
"Is a chip card the same as contactless payment (for example, PayPass)?","
            
             No. Contactless cards use near-field communication technology (NFC), which has a radio antenna that transmits account information, and work by waving or tapping your card in front of a device. Chip cards must be inserted face-up into a chip-enabled merchant terminal that allows the chip to make contact with the reader to authorize and complete a transaction.
                         
            ",contactless
Do I need a sleeve to protect information from being stolen off the chip?,"
            
             You do not need a sleeve with your Fifth Third credit card. Information is transmitted to a card reader in a highly secure manner. There are also robust fraud detection systems deployed to spot suspicious activity and stop fraud in its tracks.
                         
            ",Queries
Is my personal information vulnerable if the chip card is lost or stolen?,"
            
             No. The chip only contains information used to process transactions at a merchant terminal or ATM. No personal information is stored on the chip. As always, contact us immediately if your card is lost or stolen.
                         
            ",Queries
What does a chip-enabled terminal look like?,"
            
             Chip-enabled terminals have all of the features you are used to with a payment terminal, with the addition of a slot to insert your card. The slot is typically located at the bottom or the top of the payment terminal.
                         
            ",Queries
Why do I need a PIN for my credit card?,"
            
             Some chip terminals may prompt you for a PIN, so it is important for you to set up a PIN that you will remember. If you are a new credit card customer you are prompted to select a PIN at the time you activate your card. If your card is a replacement you already have a PIN. If you don't remember your PIN and would like to change it call the customer service number listed on the back of your card, visit your local Banking Center or click on the Service Center in Online Banking.

            ",online
Can I use my chip card outside of the U.S.?,"
            
             Yes. Chip technology is already widely used in Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom and nearly 130 other countries worldwide. Chip cards will make it easier to make purchases when you travel internationally.
                         
            ",Queries
What if my chip card doesn't work at an unattended terminal when I am in another country?,"
            
             Some card terminals at unattended locations (such as public transportation kiosks and gas pumps) may not be compatible with the chip card. You should plan for an alternative payment method, such as local currency when traveling outside the U.S.

                    Retail interest is charged on all transactions, handling fees and default charges starting on the date that they are posted or applied to your account and ending on the date that you pay the total account balance in full.

We calculate retail interest each day so the earlier you make the payment, the less retail interest you will have to pay.

Other transactions such as cash withdrawals and gambling will accrue interest daily.

                    What do I need to know about fraudulent emails (Phishing)?
                ","
                    Fraudsters engage in this activity where they attempt to impersonate your bank, credit card provider, utility company or other entity and ask you to respond by going to a dummy login page where you are requested to enter personal information which can then be used to make fraudulent transactions on your bank or credit card account. The name given to this type of fraud is Phishing.
Phishing e-mails may pretend to come from government departments such as the Revenue Commissioner, as well as banks, credit card companies and online shops.
They may sound convincing or contain realistic-looking logos and official-sounding text. They may even carry a warning about Phishing.

Remember: We will never email and ask you to enter your credit card number, login details or any personal information. If you are in doubt, always delete emails of this nature.
By responding to such e-mails or going to the website address on the email and entering your information, you are giving the fraudsters all the information they need to use your credit card to make transactions which may then appear on your monthly statement. Please bear in mind that we will always do everything in our power to help you if there are transactions on your account that are not yours.

Extra checks you can make are:
The address used by a counterfeit site may be very similar to our genuine website addresses. Look closely for spelling differences or the use of symbols, e.g. www.avant-money.ie or www.aventmoney.ie
Hidden addresses - rest your cursor over a link in an email (but don't click on it) and a box will pop up showing you the link destination - do you recognise it as a legitimate address? If not it could suggest that the sender has something to hide.

                    What do I need to know about fraudulent phone calls (Vishing)?
                ","
                    Fraudsters don't only strike online. There has been an increase in hoax phone calls with callers claiming to be bank employees or from large technology companies asking for personal details.
If the caller claims to be one of our employees and you have reason to doubt their identity, hang up and, if possible, use a different phone and dial the telephone number at the back of your credit card to check if we have tried to call you.


Example:
A phone scam that is quite common today is where the caller will claim to be technical support staff from a computer software company. They will usually tell you that they have noticed from their records that you need to have your computer urgently updated, along with a list of dangerous sounding outcomes if you do not – such as a new virus is likely to corrupt your device.


These calls can take 2 directions, both of which can lead to fraud on your account:
They may ask for remote access to your computer to install a virus which will allow then to obtain your personal details.

They may ask you for your credit card details for a payment to “fix” your computer. This may also include a request to give them your card number, expiry, 3 digit CVC number from the back of your card and even your 3D Secure password – this could allow them to either take a payment directly from your card or use your details to order large cash payments via payment channels like the Western Union.

                    Skimming is the theft of credit card information used in a legitimate transaction. The fraudster can use a small electronic device (skimmer) to swipe and store credit card numbers. Instances of skimming have been reported where the fraudster has put a device or group of devices illicitly installed on an ATM. More recently made ATMs now often run a picture of what the slot and keypad are supposed to look like as a background, so you can identify if there are any foreign devices attached.

What’s CIBIL all about?,"Founded in 2000, the Credit Information Bureau of India Limited (CIBIL) collects a record of an individual’s loans and credit cards. CIBIL, which is ISO 27001:2005 certified, is divided into two divisions, namely, consumer bureau and commercial bureau. The consumer bureau (launched in 2004) has over 260 million records while the commercial bureau (launched in 2006) has over 12 million records. TransUnion International and Dun and Bradstreet are CIBIL’s technical partners.",Score & Report
What’s a CIBIL score?,"Banks, as part of their due diligence process, gauge the creditworthiness of individuals based on credit scores. The information listed on your credit report includes several variables that CIBIL uses to set your credit score. CIBIL score, therefore, reflects the extent of the probability of a default. An individual’s credit history is submitted to CIBIL by banks and financial institutions on a monthly basis.",Score & Report
What do high and low credit score determine?,A high CIBIL credit score essentially means less probability of a default. A low CIBIL credit score reflects high probability of a default.,Score & Report
How can you get your CIBIL score?,"Log on to the CIBIL website and click on the ‘know your score’ tab to get a personalized credit score. Fill an online form which requires you to include details such as your name, date of birth, income, identity proof, address and phone number, in addition to the loans taken by you. Following payment of a certain sum, you will have to submit authentication details which include questions based on your credit history. After authentication, your credit score will be emailed to you.",Score & Report
Will checking your score have negative repercussions?,"Experts suggest checking one’s CIBIL score once a year. The practice is often considered a ‘soft inquiry’ as opposed to credit card issuers asking CIBIL for your score, known as a ‘hard inquiry’ (mentioned in the ‘enquiry section’ of your report). Also, if you apply for a loan with various banks at the same time, it will result in hard inquiries which may have a negative impact your score.",Score & Report
Will opting for a credit card decrease my score?,"If you have a zero outstanding balance on your old credit card, there is no reason to unduly worry about it and close it. If you have a credit card with a clear payment history, it will not only reflect your responsible credit behaviour but also keep your utilization rate low, which impacts your score positively.",Score & Report
Does zilch credit mean a good score?,"There are many who avoid loans like the plague, hoping that their CIBIL score will then be perfect. Nothing can be farther from the truth. If you do not borrow, you do not have a credit history and, therefore, no credit bureau can assign a score. Consequently, you might find it difficult to get a loan. Timely repayments are of seminal importance to ensure that your score remains above 750.",Score & Report
Is there only one credit bureau in the country?,"In addition to CIBIL, there are three other credit bureaus in India, namely, Experian Credit Information Co. of India Pvt. Ltd, Equifax Credit Information Services Pvt. Ltd and CRIF High Mark Credit Information Services Pvt. Ltd. Since all the three have different scoring patterns, your score may vary. Nevertheless, if you have a good CIBIL score, you will get favourable scores by others too.",Queries
Do late payments and high utilization of credit limits have a negative effect on your score?,"If you have missed payments on any of your loans over the years, your credit score would be negatively affected. A higher utilization pattern equals to more repayments and, therefore, negatively affect your score. ",Score & Report
How do more number of personal (unsecured) loans affect your score?,"More number of personal (unsecured) loans would also affect the score in a negative way since such loans have a high rate of interest compared to car or home loans and, therefore, more likely to result in defaults.",Score & Report
What if you are ‘credit hungry?’,"If you are in urgent need of moolah and applied for credit from several lenders, it will have a negative impact on your score since lenders will then be wary to issue a fresh loan while evaluating your creditworthiness.",Queries
How do you correct errors in your CIBIL report?,"RBI has made it mandatory for banks to comply with an individual's desire to access his or her credit report. If a bank declines a credit card or loan application, you can ask for the control number of your credit report. You can then contact CIBIL at info@cibil.com and communicate details of errors in the report.",Score & Report

What are the Different Types of Credit?,"Generally, credit is organized into three major buckets: Revolving credit: where a consumer borrows money from a lender and pays it back at the end or makes partial monthly payments, as in a Visa or MasterCard charge card. Charge credit: where the lender provides the consumer with a loan under the presumption that it is going to be paid in full at the end of the month, like on most American Express credit cards . Installment credit: when the consumer agrees to finance a debt with monthly payments over a predetermined period of time, such as in a home mortgage or a car payment.",Gen Info
How Do You Begin to Establish Credit?,"Credit can be established in a number of ways. Perhaps the most common is the opening of a credit card account. It can be difficult to open your first credit card, because you have no history for the creditor to view. If no one will grant you credit, a secured card (a card that requires you to pay money into an account the creditor controls before you receive a card) may be the best way to establish credit initially. You can also use low balance store cards or gas cards that let you prove that you can pay your monthly payments back, before qualifying for a larger balance credit card. These cards usually come with a high interest rate, so work hard to pay the debt in full each month, avoiding the high finance charges.",Gen Info
What Happens if Your request for Credit is Denied?,"There are a variety of reasons dictating why credit may not have been extended to you. Reasons range from insufficient income, short-time at a job or address, and/or poor credit history. You should evaluate your situation. Know that you are entitled to receive a free credit report after being denied credit along with an explanation of why you were denied. You should also know that the credit bureau is obligated to investigate and correct whatever legitimate errors you find.",Queries
What Type of Bad Credit Loans Can I Get?,"A short term loan, such as a payday loan or a cash advance are common types of loans available to people with bad credit. This type of loan requires no credit check or co-signer. However, you do need collateral to qualify for a short term loan and a checking account for the funds to be transferred to. Also, these loans come with very high interest rates. Make sure that you pay back the loan in the required time frame or you will face massive interest charges. Payday loans can have annual interest rates that exceed 1,000%! Consider this kind of financing only as an option of last resort.",Queries

In the past, anything above 690 was considered a great score. Today, you may need a score of over 720 in order to qualify for the best rates available.A credit score below a 620 is frequently referred to as ""sub-prime.""",Score & Report
How Often do Credit Scores Change?,"Your credit score is fluid; it changes as your credit information changes. Anytime new information is added to your credit report, your credit score can change.

How do you begin to establish credit?,"Consumers desirous of establishing a good credit record should start off by applying for a credit card. The companies that monitor credit history compile information based on your payments and responsible consumers build up a good credit report by promptly paying off what they owe. A second consideration, especially if the consumer did not qualify for a conventional credit card, is to apply for secured credit. This method lessens the lender's risk by having access to some kind of guaranty from the borrower in case of default. An alternative way is to have a person with a proven history of good credit co-sign a loan. A co-signer guarantees the payment on the debt, in case you default, so co-signing is risky for the co-signer.",Queries
Is There a Rule of Thumb Regarding the Number of Credit Cards to Have?,"There is no hard and fast rule on the number of cards that you can have. In general, you credit score is more related to how you use and pay your cards than the number of cards that you have open. Work to keep your credit utilization below 30% of the maximum credit limit on each card. For this reason, it is better to have a few credit cards with high credit limits than a large number of cards with limited credit limits. Having credit cards with high credit limits demonstrates that you are responsible enough to carry a high credit limit on multiple cards and prevents you from harming your score through high credit utilization.",Queries
Is it a Good Idea to Transfer my High Credit Card Balance to a New Card with a Rock-bottom Rate?,"If you want to transfer your credit card debt to a different card, you need to make sure that there are no catches with the introductory rate of the new card. For example, sometimes the low introductory interest rate on a card is only for a very limited time and then it skyrockets to an exuberant amount. You also need to consider the fee that is charged for making the transfer and to ask if there are annual fees, late charges, or any other stipulations that might make transferring your credit card debt to a new card counter-productive.",Queries

What’s the difference between “debt settlement” and a “debt management program”?,"A debt management program (also called a “debt management plan” or DMP) is a plan to repay all of your unsecured debts in full, usually with a fixed monthly payment and reduced interest costs, while debt settlement typically involves a third party helping you “settle” with your creditors in order to reduce the amount owed.

A counselor can discuss with you the risks involved in debt settlement, or you can read more about them here.",Queries
What about the difference between “bill consolidation” and a debt management program?,"Bill consolidation combines all of your outstanding debt into a new loan, while a debt management program pays off your debt through single monthly payments that are distributed to all of your creditors by a credit counseling agency like Clearpoint.

How much does a DMP cost?,"If you choose to start a debt management program, you’ll be charged a fee that varies by state: $50/month or the amount permitted by state law, whichever is less. This fee is included as part of the monthly payments you’ll make. In addition, in some states we charge a startup fee to help cover the initial costs related to working with your creditors. This fee never exceeds $75.",Queries
What’s expected of me while on a DMP?,"A debt management program is collaborative. Our counselors work tirelessly on your behalf, but there are a few guidelines a client must follow to ensure that their program is successful:",Queries
Will a debt management program hurt my credit score?,"Gradual repayment of your unsecured debt directly or through a debt management program will usually help your credit score. A DMP is a good alternative for those with damaged credit resulting from high credit card debt, late payments, missed payments, or accounts in collection.  Many creditors mark delinquent accounts as “current” after accepting your DMP and receiving three consecutive payments. Others will note on your credit record that you participated in a debt management program (although this doesn’t affect your credit score). Your counselor will let you know what to expect after reviewing your unique situation. For more information on how DMPs affect credit scores, check out this blog post.",Debt
How long will it take for me to repay my debt?,"Most of our clients repay their debt within 3–3 1/2 years. The maximum length of time you can be on a DMP is 5 years. Your counselor will estimate your payoff time during your counseling session. If during the program you are ever in a position to make larger payments, you can do so and reduce the amount of time it takes you to complete the program.",Debt
When will the calls from collection agencies end?,"Collections calls may continue for the first 90 days of your debt management program while your creditors are processing the program paperwork. During these three months, you may tell the callers that you’ve joined our DMP and refer them to our creditor relations department. After this initial period, the calls usually stop.",Queries
Can I use my credit cards during the program?,"Unfortunately, no. Any cards included in the DMP will be closed and therefore unusable. In the case of cards that for some reason cannot be included in your DMP, we strongly advise that you do not use them during the program. Your creditors will have agreed to their concessions (lower interest, waived fees, etc.) on the condition that you stop using credit until your debt is paid off. Creditors will notice if you obtain new credit or place charges on open credit accounts and they will discontinue the concessions and, most likely, drop you from the debt management program. If you have a business card not included in the plan, it’s possible that you can use it. But speak with your counselor to be sure that you’re safe to do so.",Queries
What happens if I need to get a new car or refinance my house?,"Anything that involves secured debts—including car loans and mortgages—should not affect your DMP. However, be aware that you may not be in ideal credit standing when you first start your DMP. Because your accounts will be closing as part of your program, you’ll have less available credit, which may lower your score in the short-term. (Read about how it works here.) As a result, you may not be able to get the lowest possible APR. If you do decide to shop for a car or refinance or buy a home, we strongly encourage you to first pull a copy of your credit report from annualcreditreport.com and pay the small fee to receive your score. This way you’ll know your position before you seek your loan.",Queries
Will I be eligible for new credit after completing my DMP?,"In most cases, yes. However, creditors are likely to charge higher rates until your credit has improved. Your counselor will offer tips to help you rebuild and improve your credit.",Queries
Do I need to keep making payments on my accounts before my DMP starts?,"That would be ideal, but often clients can’t afford to pay their creditors and still have enough for their first DMP payment. If this is the case, you may be late with your accounts in the process of getting your DMP started. This should have no negative effect and many creditors will perform a “re-age” on your account after they’ve accepted the proposal and you’ve made 3–4 payments. In the re-age process, the creditor brings your account to “current” status and drops any late or over-the-limit fees.","Bills,Statement & Limit"
Can I make extra or larger payments?,"Absolutely. If you can pay extra, you certainly are encouraged to do so. Just let us know how you’d like your extra funds to be distributed (all to one creditor, some to each, etc.) and we’ll be happy to set it up on your behalf.","Bills,Statement & Limit"
Can I make bi-weekly payments instead?,"Unfortunately, we can’t process partial payments. But you can easily budget for bi-weekly payments by opening a separate bank account that is used only for your monthly DMP payment. Each time you get paid, you can put half (or more) of your total monthly DMP payment into this separate account. This will have the effect of bi-weekly payments and the full payment amount will be in the account when it comes time for your monthly draft.","Bills,Statement & Limit"
How do I know that you are really paying my creditors?,"You’ll continue to receive monthly statements from each of your creditors, which will reflect the payments we make on your behalf. You’ll also receive a monthly statement from Clearpoint showing our records of your debts and the payments made to each account. In addition, after your first payment is made and distributed, you’ll be able to access your DMP information 24/7 through the secure log-in on our website.",Queries
Do you work for creditors?,"No, we are a nonprofit that works to educate you and help you achieve good financial health. Many creditors voluntarily contribute to us in order to further our mission. And clearly it is beneficial for creditors to have their debts paid in full, which is something our debt management programs accomplish. But DMPs are also the safest way for many consumers to pay down their debt and that is why we offer and recommend them. Note that creditor contributions do not affect whether we recommend a specific client for a DMP or have any bearing on which creditors can and can’t be included in a DMP. In short, creditor contributions may help us to continue helping you but don’t otherwise affect the services we offer.",Queries

In a credit scoring model, there are stronger indicators of future payment performance, such as past payment history and use of credit. Inquiries are rarely, if ever, the only reason for poor credit scores. They become significant only if there are other issues already lowering your score, such as late payments or very high debt.",Score & Report
Does every inquiry affect a credit score?,"
Anytime your credit report is pulled—including when you order a copy of your credit report directly from the credit reporting agency—an inquiry is added to your report. Inquiries made when you applied for credit cards or loans, called hard inquiries, are counted in a credit score. Inquiries made by companies making promotional offers of credit or your lender conducting periodic reviews of your existing credit accounts, called soft inquiries, do not affect your credit score. Soft inquiries also occur when you check your own credit report or when you use credit monitoring services from companies like Experian.",Score & Report
Can I use a credit score as leverage for a lower interest rate when seeking a loan or line of credit?,"
It is never a bad idea to work with issuers and lenders to reduce your interest rate. You definitely have more leverage if a credit score puts you in the low-risk range. However, because there are many different credit scores, the model used to calculate the score you obtain, and the score itself, may be different than the one the lender uses in making its decision. For instance, you may get a generic credit risk score from Experian, but an auto lender might use its own custom scoring model with a different scale. Consequently, the numbers won't be the same but will likely represent a similar level of risk.",Score & Report
Who or what decides if I get my loan?,"
Banks, credit card companies, auto dealers, retail stores and other lenders decide if you get your loan. Most businesses that issue credit or loans use credit scores to quickly summarize a consumer's credit history, saving the need to manually review an applicant's credit report and providing a better, faster decision. Although many additional factors are used in determining whether or not you receive the credit you applied for — such as an applicant's income versus the size of the loan — a credit score is a leading indicator of one's basic creditworthiness. Credit reporting agencies do not make lending decisions.",Queries

So many people treat credit cards as easy cash but treating them as a loan you need to pay back solves a lot of problems down the road. This loan is revolving debt, meaning it doesn’t have a fixed payoff date or payment, but it is money that needs to be paid back.

When you use a credit card, the lender makes you a loan usually on 0% terms for up to 28 days. If you pay the loan in that time, you pay no interest. If you don’t pay the loan off completely then the interest rate kicks in and is charged on a daily basis.",Gen Info

Retail Purchase of Rs. 5,000 on 13-10-2017
Online Purchase of Rs. 10,000 on 23-10-2017

Assuming no previous balance is carried forward from the statement dated 10-10-2017, the cardholder will get his statement dated 10-11-2017 showing transactions of Rs. 15,000. The Cardholder needs to make payment against the outstanding by 25-11-2017 i.e. Due Date (15 days from the Statement Date), for anything between the entire amount or Minimum Amount Due. If the cardholder does not make the payment of the Minimum Amount Due or more by 25-11-2017, he would be charged a Late Payment Charge of Rs. 250. GST will be applicable on late payment Charges.

**ROI considered @1.25% p.m. for illustration purpose. Actual ROI – Refer to the latest Charges Schedule
Thus, on the statement Date 10-12-17, the following will reflect as the components of the total amount payable by you:

Interest Calculated = (outstanding amount x 1.25% pm x 12 months x no of days) / 365


Therefore,
a) Interest on 1,900 @ 1.25% pm from 7th Nov. to 2nd Dec. (i.e. 26 days) = 20.30
    Interest on 300 (2,000-1,700) @ 1.25% pm from 3rd to 10th Dec (i.e. 8 days) = 0.99   
    Interest on 600 @1.25% pm from 28th Nov to 10th Dec. (i.e. 13 days) = 3.21
   Thus, total interest of Rs. 24.50
b) Late payment charges = Rs. 250
c) Total principal amount outstanding = Rs. 900.00
(600 fresh spend + balance 300 outstanding from last month's billing period)
Hence, total Amount Due = (a) + (b) + (c) = Rs. 1,174.50

"I mailed my payment four days before it was due, but the card issuer says it was late. What can I do?","Under the law, a card issuer cannot treat a payment as late if it was received by 5 p.m. on the day that it was due. If the due date was not a day on which the issuer receives mail (for example, a holiday), the issuer cannot treat the payment as late if it was received by 5 p.m. on the next business day.

I paid off my entire bill when it was due last month and still got charged interest. How can that be?,"Different card issuers have different rules for determining when they charge interest. In general, once a card issuer begins to charge interest it will continue to do so until it receives your payment.  This means that if you have been carrying a balance, you will be charged interest – sometimes called “residual interest” – from the time your bill was sent to you until the time your payment is received by your card issuer.",Interest & APR

I received a notice saying the card issuer was going to change the terms of my account. Can they do that?  What can I do?,"The card issuer has the right to change the terms of the agreement. For “significant changes,” the card issuer must give you 45 days advance notice. Significant changes generally involve the interest rate, fees, grace period, minimum amount due, and the method for calculating interest charges. Significant changes generally do not include changes to the benefits you get from your credit card, such as points or cash rewards, or changes in the brand (for example, changing from Visa to MasterCard or vice versa).",Queries
I received an offer for a credit card and it said that I was prescreened. What does this mean? Am I guaranteed to be approved if I apply?,"Card issuers may use a credit reporting agency to make firm offers of credit to consumers whose credit histories meet the criteria asked for by the card issuer (for example, a minimum credit score). This does not mean the credit card issuer must provide you with a credit card. You must still apply. Once you apply, the card issuer can review your application and other information, such as an updated credit report, to determine whether your credit history still meets the criteria it asked for and whether you meet any additional criteria (such as sufficient income to pay the debt) that were in place at the time it made the offer.  ",Queries
I received an offer from my card issuer to transfer balances from another credit card at a low rate. How long does the rate have to stay in effect?,"The introductory rate has to stay in effect for at least six months. The card issuer is required to tell you how long you will have the introductory rate and what rate will apply after the introductory period. If the introductory rate is variable, it can change during the first six months if the index upon which it is based (for example, the “prime rate”) changes.",Queries
I received my bill this month and the payment is due the same day as usual but the bill came much later than usual. Can I get more time to pay?,"Under the law, a credit card issuer must establish procedures which are designed to ensure that statements are mailed to cardholders at least 21 days before a payment is due.

You should be able to find a copy of the agreement on your card issuer’s website, and you can request a copy from your card issuer if it is not there.

After you opt in, the issuer must send you a confirmation that you have agreed to allow over limit charges.",Charges & Fees
"If I am married, can a card issuer turn down my application for a credit card in my own name?","No. Credit card issuers may not refuse to open an account because of your marital status. You may obtain your own credit card if warranted by your individual credit profile, income, and assets. Your own credit card means a separate account in your own name, not a joint account with your spouse or a duplicate card on his/her account. If you are creditworthy, a card issuer generally may not require that your spouse co-sign your account. In general, a card issuer may not even ask for information about your spouse or former spouse when you apply for your own credit card based on your own income, unless that income is alimony, child support, or separate maintenance payments from your spouse or former spouse. (This does not apply if your spouse is going to use your account or be responsible for paying your debts on the account. It also does not apply if you live in a community property state. The community property states are Alaska (if you sign a special agreement), Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin.)",Queries
I've lost my credit card. What should I do?,It is critical that you report the loss or theft of your credit card to the card issuer as quickly as possible.

Follow those instructions.,"Fraud,Loss,Theft & Disputes"

The card issuer increased my interest rate on my existing balance. Can they do that?  What can I do to get the rate back down?,"A card issuer can increase the interest rate on existing balances only if you are at least 60 days late in paying your required minimum amount unless an exception applies (for example, the exception for variable rate accounts). If you pay your minimum amount on time for the first six consecutive months after the rate increase, the issuer generally must reinstate the prior rate.",Interest & APR
The card issuer increased my interest rate to 30 percent. Isn’t that illegal?,There is no federal law that limits the interest rate that a card issuer can charge. The maximum interest rate is generally determined by state law. The law of the state where the card issuer has its headquarters generally determines the maximum interest rate the card issuer can charge.,Interest & APR

But the law bars discrimination based on age, sex, marital status, race, color, religion, and national origin in deciding whether to extend credit to an applicant, in deciding the terms (such as the interest rate or credit limit), or in any other aspect of a credit transaction.
